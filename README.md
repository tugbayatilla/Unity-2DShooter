# 2D Shooter Assignment

## Overview

In this assignment, you will complete the 2D Shooter project. In part 1 of this assignment you will follow along with a tutorial to create a 2D Shooter and then in part 2, you will modify the game to transform it into your own.

## Instructions

- Follow along with the videos that accompany this lesson to build the basis of your game.
- Modify what you created in the tutorial to transform it into your own game. The game should have at least three significant modifications from the tutorial. See the list possible modifications below.
- Come up with a new name for your game and change the UI in the game to reflect the new name.
- Play your game several times and make sure there are no bugs (code issues), flaws in gameplay, or look-and-feel issues. If there are, fix them.
- Make sure to include all necessary scenes in the Unity "Build Settings..."
- Ideally create Windows, MacOS, and WebGL builds of the project (but at least 2 out of 3). NOTE: For WebGL, make sure to select "Decompression Fallback" in the "Publishing Settings" within "Player Settings" prior to building WebGL. Some computer configurations have trouble building to WebGL, particularly if you use non-English characters in your file structure. If this is the case, Windows and MacOS builds will suffice.
- Test that your build works. NOTE: Ideally you can test on all platforms but you should test at least one (Windows or Mac). NOTE: It is difficult to test WebGL games locally due to security features in the browser. You can test WebGL once you submit the build to itch.io below.
- Create a ZIP compressed archive of each of the build folders. To create a zip archive in Windows, you can right-click on a folder then select "Send To->Compressed (zipped) Folder" from the contextual menu. To create a zip archive in MacOS, you can right-clicking on a folder and then select "Compress" from the contextual menu.
- Create a page on itch.io for your game.
- Include at least two screenshots that demonstrate the game working. You can use the "ScreenshotUtility" prefab included in the project assets to easily grab screenshots within Unity.
- Optionally include a cover image.
- Include the builds created above. For Windows and Mac builds, make sure to select "Executable" and select the corresponding platform. For WebGL, make sure to click "This file will be played in the browser". 
- Include a description of your actual modifications to the game (at least 3) AND your game credits ("Created by ...").
- Set the "Release Status" to "Released".
- Set the Pricing to "No Payment"
- Save the page and click "View page"
- Make sure the screenshots show by clicking on "Edit Theme" and set the "Screenshots" layout to "Sidebar" and save.
- Click "Edit Game" again and set the Visibility to "Public". You can also check "Unlisted in search & browse".
- Make any other desired modifications.
- Save the page and then click "View page" to bring up what your players will see.
- S​ubmit the itch.io URL to the peer review assignment in Module 4. You are responsible for ensuring that you've submitted correctly according to these instructions. Test your submission on another computer if possible.

## M​odification Suggestions

- The game should have at least three significant modifications beyond what you put together in part 1, across the following categories:
### Design Modifications (these are more design intensive), such as:

  - Create a complete interesting, comprehensive, and coherent level. 
  - Add multiple additional levels and tie them in to create a logical progression in your game. (NOTE: Each level should be unique in some way, such as different type of challenges for the player.)
  - Modify the out-of-game menus in some significant and meaningful way.

### Aesthetic (Visual/Audio) Modifications (these are more art intensive), such as:

- Reskin the existing graphics in some significant way, such as change the player or an enemy to a completely different character.
- Add additional significant and coherent graphical elements to the game, such as new enemies or environmental challenges, complete with animated states.
- Replace sound effects in the game to update the sound design of the game. (NOTE: You will need to change ALL the sound effects for this to be significant. Don't just change one.)
- Add custom music to your game. (NOTE: Custom meaning you created the music with a tool such as Garage Band or Fruity Loops. If you just swap out the music for another track you find, this is not considered a significant change ... though you can do it without it counting as a significant modification.)

### Gameplay Modifications (these are more system/programming intensive), such as:

- Add new player abilities, such as modified controls, additional moves, or additional power ups.
- Add new enemies with their own behavior. (NOTE: This can be considered two modifications if you create unique behavior AND create the art and animation.)
- Add new obstacles and challenges. (NOTE: This can be considered two modifications if you create unique behavior AND create the art and animation.)
- Modify the in-game GUI in some significant way.

You can use the examples above or come up with your own modifications. Be creative. Push yourself. This is your chance to differentiate your game, make something portfolio worthy, and impress us your fellow learners.
