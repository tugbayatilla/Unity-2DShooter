# 2D Shooter Assignment

## Mâ€‹odification Suggestions

- The game should have at least three significant modifications beyond what you put together in part 1, across the following categories:

### Design Modifications (these are more design intensive), such as:

  - Create a complete interesting, comprehensive, and coherent level. 
  - Add multiple additional levels and tie them in to create a logical progression in your game. (NOTE: Each level should be unique in some way, such as different type of challenges for the player.)
  - Modify the out-of-game menus in some significant and meaningful way.

### Aesthetic (Visual/Audio) Modifications (these are more art intensive), such as:

- Reskin the existing graphics in some significant way, such as change the player or an enemy to a completely different character.
- Add additional significant and coherent graphical elements to the game, such as new enemies or environmental challenges, complete with animated states.
- Replace sound effects in the game to update the sound design of the game. (NOTE: You will need to change ALL the sound effects for this to be significant. Don't just change one.)
- Add custom music to your game. (NOTE: Custom meaning you created the music with a tool such as Garage Band or Fruity Loops. If you just swap out the music for another track you find, this is not considered a significant change ... though you can do it without it counting as a significant modification.)

### Gameplay Modifications (these are more system/programming intensive), such as:

- Add new player abilities, such as modified controls, additional moves, or additional power ups.
- Add new enemies with their own behavior. (NOTE: This can be considered two modifications if you create unique behavior AND create the art and animation.)
- Add new obstacles and challenges. (NOTE: This can be considered two modifications if you create unique behavior AND create the art and animation.)
- Modify the in-game GUI in some significant way.
